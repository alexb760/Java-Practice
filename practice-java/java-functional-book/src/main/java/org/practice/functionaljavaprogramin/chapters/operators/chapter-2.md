# Summary.

A function is a relation between a source set and a target set. It establishes a correspondence between the elements of the source set (the domain) and the elements of the target set (the codomain).

Pure functions have no visible effects beside returning a value.

Functions have only one argument, which may be a tuple of several elements.

Functions of tuples may be curried in order to apply them to one element of the tuple at a time.

When a curried function is applied to only some of its arguments, we say that itâ€™s partially applied.

In Java, functions may be represented by methods, lambdas, method references, or anonymous classes.

Method references are the preferred representation for functions.

Functions may be composed to create new functions.

Functions can call themselves recursively, but the recursion depth is limited by the size of the stack.

Lambdas and method references can be used in places where a functional interface is expected.
